This demo implements the simple [filesystem application][1] shown at the
end of the Ruby client-side mapping chapter.

You will need to start a server from one of the other supported language
mappings. If you want to get started quickly, we recommend using the
Python server.

In a separate window, run the client:

```
ruby client.rb
```

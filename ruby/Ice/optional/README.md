This demo illustrates the use of [optional class members][1] and
[parameters][2].

The Ice extension for Ruby currently supports only client-side
functionality, therefore you must use a server from any other language
mapping. If you want to get started quickly, we recommend using the
Python server.

After starting the server, run the Ruby client:

```
ruby client.rb
```

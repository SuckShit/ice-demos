A simple latency test that measures the basic call dispatch delay of
Ice.

To run the demo, first you need to start an Ice latency server from
another language mapping (Java, C++, C#, or Python). If you want to
get started quickly, we recommend using the Python server.

After starting the server, open a separate window and start the
client:

```
node Client.js
```

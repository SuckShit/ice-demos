This demo illustrates the use of [optional class members][1] and
[parameters][2].

First, compile all the demo Slice files (see [php/README.md](../../README.md)),
or compile just this demo's Slice file with `slice2php`:
```
slice2php *.ice
```

Then, start the optional demo server, using any of the supported
language mappings, on this host. If you want to get started quickly,
we recommend using the Python server.

Finally, run the PHP client:

```
php Client.php
```

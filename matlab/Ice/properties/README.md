This demo illustrates how to access a server's [Properties facet][1]
in order to retrieve and modify its configuration properties. This
demo also shows how the server can receive notifications whenever its
properties are changed.

Ice for MATLAB currently supports only client-side functionality, therefore
you must use a server from any other language mapping. If you want to get
started quickly, we recommend using the Python server.

After starting the server, run the MATLAB client:

```
client
```

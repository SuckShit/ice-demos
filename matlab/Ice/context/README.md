This demo illustrates how to use Ice [request contexts][1].

Ice for MATLAB currently supports only client-side functionality, therefore
you must use a server from any other language mapping. If you want to get
started quickly, we recommend using the Python server.

After starting the server, run the MATLAB client:

```
client
```
